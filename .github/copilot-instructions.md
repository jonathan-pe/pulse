This app is a prediction-based sports app with a gamified approach while steering clear of gambling elements

It will utilize React (Next.js), Tailwind CSS for styling, and TypeScript

We'll also be using Next.js's app router instead of the older /pages router so pages will be defined under the /app directory

We'll be using OddsBlaze for our sports odds API

Some components will be grabbed from shadcn

yarn will be our preferred package manager

The app's name is "Pulse"

We use Supabase for our API and Postgres DB management

We use the next-auth package for authentication management
